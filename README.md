## Hey there! Thanks for coming

### About me:
I'm a back-end developer. I currently work as a junior back-end at [ABC EVO](https://w12.com.br/).<br>
My github has seen a lot of activity lately, but that's because I'm studying every day to become better and better at what I do.
<br>

### ðŸ“š I am currently studying:
- Task automation with Python
- .NET Framework
- Flutterflow
